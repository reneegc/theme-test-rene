              Not to brag, but we don’t take shortcuts. We bring dried chickpeas
              in-house and soak them ourselves so that we can produce our
              homemade falafels and hummus using the most natural ingredients.
              Combine that with our fresh selection of bell peppers, lemons, red
              onions, and garlic cloves -- and you can taste the difference. We
              don’t cut corners, we cut fresh ingredients.
